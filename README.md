It is split into 3 parts:  
  ##### 1. Animated Tutorial on how to fold the basic 3D Origami piece. 
  ##### 2. Video Tutorial on the different ways to connect 3D Origami pieces together to make models.
  ##### 3. The 3D Origami Generator that lets you generate and color models in any size you want. You are able to create increased, decreased and inverted rows.
